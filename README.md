
## UK House Price Change over the period 1992-2022

&nbsp;

**Overview**

With house price data from the Office of National Statistics, I created a series of tables and charts showing change over time in 3 financial categories; Average dwelling price, average recorded income of purchasers/mortgage borrowers, and average advance put forward. These data were also broken down by borrower category (First-time buyers vs former owner occupiers) and dwelling status (all dwellings vs new dwellings vs other dwellings). I then created inflation-adjusted data for these categories. 

Some key takeaways include:

For both inflation-adjusted data and non-inflation-adjusted data there was a significant change over time in all categories. 
Some key takeaways include:

 - Overall (and almost completely consistent) increase from 1992-2022 in dwelling price across all dwelling and borrower categories, inflation-adjusted and non-adjusted in all regions besides Northern Ireland, which had a large peak around the time of the GFC and is yet to reach those levels again
 - On a regional level, only Northern Ireland stood out from the others. In this region, there was consistently a significant peak around the 2008 GFC in all financial categories, with a fall afterwards and levels only now in the 2020s reaching or close to reaching the same level again
 - There were noticeable but far less significant affects of the 2008 GFC in almost every category for all other regions
 - Recorded incomes of borrowers have also increased when adjusting for inflation, along with house prices, though house prices have increased between 80-150%, whereas incomes have only increased between 20-50%

It seems overall that the most prominent trends are the rapid increase of house pricing and subsequent advances required, at a rate that far outpaces the increase of wages of those buying, whether inflation is considered or not.

**Data processing**

 - Data for Dwelling prices, mortgage cost and borrower income in the United Kingdom, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland sourced from the ONS
 - Inflation data sourced from in2013dollars.com
 - Original CSV source files provided tables which needed to be reformatted through creating entirely new worksheets in order to be used properly
 - Pivot tables and graphs were made with the reformatted tables showing trends over time
 - Further Inflation-Adjusted data created through calculations to supplement original data 
 - Overall changes were calculated through using relevant formulae (XLOOKUP, VLOOKUP, CONCATENATE etc), further pivot tables and graphs to contrast with non-inflation-adjusted data were made
